           // This assessment will involve a console application to get a list of nobel laureates
           // from a local json store and create a pastebin.

           // - The first step is to write a method that will return the list AND print (Console.WriteLine)
           //   the list of laureates based on criteria that might change.

           //   For example, the criteria could be to print all laureates based on category, year, or even for something in the 'motivation'.

           // - For this exercise, we want to get a list of laureates in medicine before the year 1980.


           // - The second step is create a method to leverage the pastebin api (https://pastebin.com/doc_api#1) to create a pastebin
           //   where the contents of the pastebin will be the report.

           // - Finally, create a method that will allow us to delete the pastebin.

           // Note: The API Key will have been sent out via email.
           // Note: Newtonsoft is included in the nuget packages for convenience, but it is optional
           //       and you may use any other library of your choosing.
